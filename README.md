## Day 1: TypeScript

Fundamentals of TypeScript, including setting up a TypeScript project with the Angular CLI, exploring data types, variables, functions, and classes. Understand modules and module resolution in TypeScript.

## Day 2: Introduction, Setup, and Architecture

Get introduced to Angular and its features. Set up the development environment using Node.js and npm. Create a new Angular project with the Angular CLI. Explore the basic folder structure and files generated by the Angular CLI. Understand the core architectural components of Angular, such as modules, components, templates, and services.

## Day 3: Components and Data Bindings

Learn about Angular components, their structure, and how to create and use them. Explore data binding techniques, including property binding, event binding, and two-way binding. Understand component lifecycle hooks and their usage.

## Day 4: Directives and Pipes

Explore Angular directives and their types: structural and attribute directives. Learn how to use built-in directives and create custom directives. Understand the concept of Angular pipes and how to use them for data transformation and formatting.

## Day 5: Forms and Validation

Dive into Angular forms and form validation. Learn how to create template-driven forms and reactive forms. Understand form controls, form groups, and form validation techniques using built-in and custom validators.

## Day 6: Routing and Navigation

Discover Angular's routing and navigation capabilities. Learn how to set up routes, define route parameters, and handle route navigation. Explore nested routes and lazy loading modules for optimizing application performance.

## Day 7: Dependency Injection and Services

Understand the concept of dependency injection in Angular and its benefits. Learn how to create and use services to share data and functionality across components. Explore hierarchical injectors and the providedIn syntax for service registration.

## Day 8: State Management with NgRx

Introduce state management using NgRx, a powerful library for managing application state in Angular. Learn about the Store, Actions, Reducers, and Effects in NgRx. Understand how to dispatch actions, modify the state, and handle asynchronous operations.

## Day 9: Performance Optimization

Learn about performance optimization techniques in Angular. Explore lazy loading modules, preloading strategies, and code splitting. Understand change detection strategies, OnPush change detection, and the use of trackBy for efficient rendering.

## Day 10: Testing Angular

Discover different testing approaches and tools in Angular. Learn how to write unit tests for components, services, and directives using TestBed and Jasmine. Explore end-to-end (E2E) testing using Protractor. Understand testing best practices and code coverage.

Feel free to expand on these brief descriptions by providing more detailed explanations, examples, and code snippets in your documentation.
